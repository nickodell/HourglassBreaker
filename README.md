# HourglassBreaker

This is a python program that can open files encrypted by [Hourglass](https://github.com/NateBrune/Hourglass) by bruteforcing the key protecting the file.

It does not matter how many iterations you've set in Hourglass, because the underlying encryption is only 16-bit.

A test vector is included. HourglassBreaker works best on medium length messages. If it's too short, then the CRC isn't effective, and multiple keys produce a file that checksums correctly. The longer the file is, the longer HB will take.

## Example usage

    $ time ./bruteforce.py todecrypt
    Solution found!
    key = 0x2a4f
    plaintext = b'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n'
    flags = 2

    real	0m3.239s
    user	0m3.240s
    sys	0m0.000s

Python 3

## Bugs

Doesn't support qCompress. If you get 'flags = 3' and a bunch of gobbledygook, that's because the data is compressed.
